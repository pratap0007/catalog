# OpenShift Provisioning

The following task helps you to provision the Openshift cluster using the Installer Provided Infrastructure on the desired cloud platform. Supported cloud platforms are :-

- AWS
- GCP

Guide to provision a cluster on AWS can be found [here](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-customizations.html) and for GCP can be found [here](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-customizations.html)

## `OpenShift-Create`

The following task is used to create the cluster.

### **Install the Task**

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tektoncd/catalog/v1beta1/openshift-provision/openshift-cluster-create.yaml
```

### **Parameters**

- **PLATFORM**: The cloud platform where you want to create your openshift cluster (accepted values are `aws` and `gcp`).
- **BASE_DOMAIN**: The base domain of the cloud provider.
- **CLUSTER_NAME**: The desired name of the cluster.
- **REPLICAS**: Required replicas for the cluster.
- **REGION**: The region to deploy your cluster in.
- **PROJECT_ID**: The project id is required in case of deploying at google cloud platform (`gcp`).
- **OPENSHIFT_INSTALLER_IMAGE**: OpenShift installer base image for UPI installation (_default_: quay.io/openshift/origin-upi-installer:4.4)

### **Workspaces**

- **secrets**: A workspace that consists of credentials required by the cloud provider as a service account which needs to be mounted to their default path as required by the cluster.

- **install-dir**: The `PersistentVolume` workspace which will contain all the files generated by the `openshift-install` which later can be used at the time of destroying the cluster.

### **Secrets**

- The pull secret is obtained from the Pull Secret page on the Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager [site](https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install) by selecting the appropriate `Infrastructure Cloud Provider` and installation type as `Installer-provisioned infrastructure`. You can use this pull secret to authenticate with the services that are provided by the included authorities.

- The public ssh key used for password-less authentication. The public ssh key can be generated by:
  ```
  ssh-keygen -y -f ~/.ssh/openshift-dev.pem > ~/.ssh/openshift-dev.pub
  ```
  or
  ```
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "<email id>"
  ```
  and then the public key can be obtained by
  ```
  cat ~/.ssh/openshift-dev.pub
  ```

## Usage

Taking example of AWS :-

1. Create the PVC

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: install-dir
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 2Gi
```

2. Create the secrets (taking an example of mouting AWS credentials and config)

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: openshift-install
type: Opaque
stringData:
  pull-secret: $(pull-secret)
  public-ssh-key: $(public-ssh-key)
```

The secrets for the respected cloud platform can be mounted as (taking `aws` as an example):-

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: aws-credentials
type: Opaque
stringData:
  credentials: |-
    [profile-name]
    aws_access_key_id     = $(access-key-id)
    aws_secret_access_key = $(secret-access-key)
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id     = $(access-key-id)
    aws_secret_access_key = $(secret-access-key)
  config: |-
    [profile profile-name]
    region = $(region)
    output = json
```

3. Creating `TaskRun` for the OpenShift Create:

```
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: TaskRun
metadata:
  name: install-run
spec:
  taskRef:
    name: openshift-install
  params:
    - name: PLATFORM
      value: aws
    - name: CLUSTER_NAME
      value: test-cluster
    - name: BASE_DOMAIN
      value: devcluster.openshift.com
    - name: REPLICAS
      value: 3
    - name: REGION
      value: us-east-2
  workspaces:
    - name: install-dir
      persistentvolumeclaim:
        claimName: install-dir
    - name: secrets
      secret:
        secretName: aws-credentials
```

**_NOTE_**

- To access the cluster created in other tasks we need to use the same `Workspace` and keep the `workingDir: $(workspaces.workspaces-name.path)` and to login into the cluster in the next Tekton Task do the following :-
  ```
  export KUBECONFIG=auth/kubeconfig
  ```
  and to get the URL for OpenShift webconsole do the following :-
  ```
  cat auth/webaccess
  ```
